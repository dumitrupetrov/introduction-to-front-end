    <p><i><b>Pupin's 1899 patent</i> for loading coils</b>, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work of 
        the English physicist and mathematician <i>Oliver Heaviside</i>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. </p>
      <p>The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by <b>American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T)</b>, 
        making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development 
        in hand led by <i>George Campbell</i> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would 
        lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and
        especially submarine ones.
